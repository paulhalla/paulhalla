### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paul and I like to solve problems with data.

I'm currently interested in:

- Best practices for doing data modelling with Snowflake, BigQuery & dbt
- Best practices for building data pipelines and doing ETL using Snowflake, GCP more generally
- All and any other cool advances in analytics engineering and data engineering
